This gave me data for the player anthroprometric data. This data had to be manually pasted into an excel document as exporting / auto-scraping the data was proving difficult. I went back as far as 03/04 (this is the draft class that contained LeBron James, who I'm quite sure will be the earliest player drafted given the criteria I'll be using in this project)"
